Hi all,

Great, thanks so much for agreeing to release the modified 2014 model code under the GNU
AGPL license!

Hi Laurel, Danny & Zilany,

I’m okay with the GNU AGPL.

Thanks Danny,

Unless Ian responds that a license for the 2014 AN model was ‘procured’ at some point,
then I agree with your suggestion to add a GNU AGPL to the code that is included with
your Julia wrapper. [redacted]

THANKS! -Laurel

Hi all,

[redacted — here the nature of the Julia BinaryBuilder.jl system is explained to motivate
 the need for a license file or permission to relicense the modified code.]
 
I'm partial to GNU AGPL, but totally open to discussion!

Best,
Danny

Hi Laurel and Ian,

[redacted] 

Regarding the license, we don’t have any so far, however, Ian can confirm that. I would be
happy to go with you both and whatever needs to be done from my side, I would definitely do
that.

Thanks,

Zilany

Hi Ian and Zilany,

[redacted]

I’m writing about licensing for the AN model (the 2014 version). [redacted]

Our post-doc, Danny Guest, has implemented a version of the code in Julia, and would like to
post it publicly along with the code for figures, etc., in a publication that was just
accepted for JASA. [redacted] Let me know i) if there already is a license, ii) if not, 
whether you have any objection to getting one, and iii) if it’s OK for Danny to take care of 
identifying a suitable one. [redacted]

Thanks, Laurel
